# Python Fundamentals Tutorial

Hey guys, I am Steven Balibuno and Welcome to the Python Fundamentals Tutorial. Here I will be talking about topics that every beginning Python programmer should understand:

- [Stack](-stack.md)
- [Set](SETS.md)
- [Tree](3-tree.md)

Each module will contain descriptions and examples.  At the end of each module, you will find a problem to solve on your own.  You should only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem first.
