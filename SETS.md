# SET:

A set is a data structure that can store any number of unique values in any order you so wish. They are different from arrays in the sense that they only allow non-repeated, unique values within them.

They are used to store multiple items in a single variable. They can be also be used to carry out mathematical set operations like union, intersection, difference and symmetric difference.



There are different types of set operations like set-union and set-intersection.



. Set-union: A set-union is the union of two sets is the set of all the elements of both the sets without duplicates.

  An example:
                                                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                # Set union method
                      # initialize A and B
                      A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
                      B = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
                      # use | operator
                      # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
                      print(A | B)                                                                                                                                                                  


          
. Set-intersection: A set-intersection is the intersection of two sets is the set of all the common elements of both the sets.

An Example of a set is:

                   thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

                    print(len(thisset))
