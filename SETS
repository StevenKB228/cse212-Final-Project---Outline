SET:

A set is an abstract data type that will store an unordered collection of unique values. They are used to store multiple items in a single variable. 
They can be also be used to carry out mathematical set operations like union, intersection, difference and symmetric difference.
There are different types of set operations like set-union and set-intersection.

           .Set-union: A set-union is the union of two sets is the set of all the elements of both the sets without duplicates.
          
           . Set-intersection: A set-intersection is the intersection of two sets is the set of all the common elements of both the sets.

An Example of a set is:

                   thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

                    print(len(thisset))
