# cse212-Final-Project---Outline
Hey guys, I am Steven Balibuno and welcome to my Programming with data structures final outline tutorial. Here I will be talking about things programmers should know or learn about like stacks, Set, and Tree.

1. Stack:

Stacks are bundles of software that comprise your site's back end and everything from the operating system and web servers to APIs and programming frameworks. Stacks follow the Last In, First Out principle which is also known as LIFO. Stacks have two basics operations which are arrey's and Linked List.

An array is a random-access container, meaning any element of this container can be accessed instantly. An example is 
                      void main(){
                        int *ptr_array[6];
                        int al=1.a2=2. a3=3 ,a4=4, i;
                        int int_array[] = {10,20};}
                        
A linked list in the other hand is a sequential-access container, meaning that elements of this data structure can only be accessed sequentially.
