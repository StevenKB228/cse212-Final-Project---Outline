# cse212-Final-Project---Outline
Hey guys, I am Steven Balibuno and welcome to my Programming with data structures final outline tutorial. Here I will be talking about things programmers should know or learn about like stacks, Set, and Tree.

1. Stack:

Stacks are bundles of software that comprise your site's back end and everything from the operating system and web servers to APIs and programming frameworks. Stacks follow the Last In, First Out principle which is also known as LIFO. Stacks have two basics operations which are arrey's and Linked List.

An array is a random-access container, meaning any element of this container can be accessed instantly. An example is 
                      void main(){
                        int *ptr_array[6];
                        int al=1.a2=2. a3=3 ,a4=4, i;
                        int int_array[] = {10,20};}
                        
A linked list in the other hand is a sequential-access container, meaning that elements of this data structure can only be accessed sequentially. An example is 
                                                         class DoublyLinkedList
                                                             attr_accessor :head, :tail, :length
                                                             
                                                             def initialize()
                                                                @head = nil
                                                                @tail = nil
                                                                @length = 0
                                                              end
                                                              
2. Set:



 A set is an abstract data type that will store an unordered collection of unique values. Normally,  the elements are similar type of numbers but a set can be made up of elements of different types. An example of sets is :
 
 >>> first_set = set(("Connor", 32, (1, 2, 3)))
>>> first_set
{32, 'Connor', (1, 2, 3)}

Sets have a few basic operations like Set union and Set intersection. Set union is the set of all the elements of both the sets without duplicates. You use the union() to find the union of a Python set. An example is 

>>> first_set = {1, 2, 3}
>>> second_set = {3, 4, 5}
>>> first_set.union(second_set)
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

A Set intersectio is the set of all the common elements of both the sets. You can use the intersection() method to find the intersection of a Python set. An example is
>>> first_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
>>> second_set = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
>>> first_set.intersection(second_set)
{4, 5, 6}
>>>
 
 3. Tree

A tree is a nonlinear data structure, compared to arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues which are linear data structures. A tree can be empty with no nodes or a tree is a structure consisting of one node called the root and zero or one or more subtrees.There are many operations performed in a tree like insertion which can be performed in various ways depending on where you need to insert the new element.
