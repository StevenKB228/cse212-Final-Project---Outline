# cse212-Final-Project---Outline
Hey guys, I am Steven Balibuno and welcome to my Programming with data structures final outline tutorial. Here I will be talking about things programmers should know or learn about like stacks, Set, and Tree.

1. Stack:

Stacks are bundles of software that comprise your site's back end and everything from the operating system and web servers to APIs and programming frameworks. Stacks follow the Last In, First Out principle which is also known as LIFO. We use stacks because they enables all data to operate at one end only. So the only element that can be removed is the element at the top of the stack, and only one item can be read or removed at a given time. Stacks are faster due to the access pattern which makes it important to allocate and deallocate memory from a pointer.

Stacks have two basic operations which are push and pop. Push adds an element to the collection and Pop removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.
      
Example 1.
    
     begin
    if stack is full
       return
      endif
    else  
      increment top
      stack[top] assign value
     end else
     end procedure                            Example 2.

                                                         class DoublyLinkedList
                                                             attr_accessor :head, :tail, :length
                                                             
                                                             def initialize()
                                                                @head = nil
                                                                @tail = nil

                                                                @length = 0
                                                              end
