# cse212-Final-Project---Outline
Hey guys, I am Steven Balibuno and this is my final project outline.


Conditionals:

What I will be doing for my final project will be to create a data structure tutorial about everything I've learned in class so far. I will talk about conditionals which are the way computers can make decisions. Examples of conditionals are Boolean expression and multiples.

Boolean Expressions are logical statements that are either TRUE or FALSE. An example is 
"Ask the user to type in their age in whole years
Store the input data in the variable Age
If Age<16
	Set EntranceFee = 200
Otherwise
	Set EntranceFee = 1200"


Multiple Conditions are statements that are created by the programmer which evaluates actions in the program and evaluates if it's true or false. An example is

">>> temperature = 35
>>> temperature > 25
True"

Loops: 

A loop is a sequence of instruction s that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached. Loops have For Loops (Iterators) which is the process of looping through the objects or items in a collection. An example is:
								For row = 1 To 10
									cells(row,1) = row
								Next row

You can use Range with For Loops to repeat an action in a specific number of times. A good example is:  
		For i in range (0,rows):|
			for j in range (0,i+1):
				print("*",end=' ')



You can also use While Loops which is a type of loop that is used when you don't know exactly how many times the code will repeat. An example of a while loop is : 
					{
					System.out.println(i);
					i++;
					} while (i <=10);
